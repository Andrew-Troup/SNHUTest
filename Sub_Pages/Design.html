							<h2>Description and Narrative</h2>
						</header>
						<p>The design phase of this project was the only portion of the project that had any carry over from another course. Therefore, in this category I was quite set off. The only thing that I had to improve upon was increasing the scope of the project.</p>
						<p>The way that I increased the scope was by adding in search capabilities in my UI; as well as, develop an UI. The original requirements did not state the inclusion of a UI into the class and courses record system, but since I enjoy developing UIs, I thought that it would be a fun addition.</p>

							<h2>Project Layout and Design<br />
							How I structure my projects using MVVM</h2>
						</header>
						<p>MVVM stands for Model View View-Model. This structure decouples the view and the model to prevent excessess within either the view or the model. Allowing the View-Model to perform the majority of the work.</p>
						<p>I broke the solution into 3 projects Common, Core Application, and Database Communications. The purpose of Common is to provide both Database Communications and Core Application with classes that both can use. Core Application is the majority of the solution, it contains everything pertaining to the UI. Finally, Database Communications contains all classes that pertian to communicating with the database.</p>
						<p>By following MVVM it is easy to form a file structure that is similar. Inside of Core Application we can see it best. The ModelHandlers folder contains the majority of the View-Models; same as, Models or User Interfaces. Then in each primary folder I created sub-folders; for instance, Models' Records contains Admin, Class, and Student. These sub-folders contain Model classes that pertain purely to the classes directory.</p>
						<p>The final thing I want to note about my project structure is the extraneous folder; for an example, Base or Support. Inside of the base Base folder it contains only inherited classes. Every Base folder in my project will only contain classes that are inherited from. Inside of Support you will find classes that assist the containing support folder. For instance, I have a class called ClassesBeingTaught, this is a Model class that supports AdminRecord. (look at the class diagram below for more information)</p>

							<h2>Class Diagram<br />
							The Three Regions</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Region 1, at the top, is the class and course record handlers and model views. In these classes we are handling the information being stored locally; as well as, the how the infromation is going to be displayed.</p>
						<p>Region 2 which contains all of the student information. Such as personal information or class history. In this both the student and teacher can view and edit this information.</p>
						<p>Region 3 is in the middle, it is how my UI handles the administrative views. The information being stored in the Administrative model classes would be information like admin's personal information and classes they are teaching. </p>

							<h2>UI Design<br />
							The structure and flow of my UI</h2>
						</header>
						<p>The design is simple, if we look at the first image the layout has 2 regions, left and right sides. The left-hand side is typically driven by the right-hand side selection. For instance, if we are in the course and class region, then the left side will be populated with class information based upon the user selection.</p>
						<p>The black region, of the first image, are controls that will populate the left side; as well as, controls that contain a collection of data. The orange region are controls that are loaded by the right side, and provide the user with the ability to edit, depending on the user type. Finally, the blue is associated to the login window that is spawned by the main layout.</p>
						<p>With the knowledge of what each of the groups are used for, I need to talk a bit about the layout and how each are related. Everything that has Student, Admin, or Course are pair together. For instance, student view will be displayed when the user is of type Admin, this is because the AdminStudentTreeView will contain classes that the Admin is currently teaching, which in each class there will be students. The user could select students and they will be displayed in the StudentRecordLayout.</p>
						<p>Finally, I want to touch on the sub controls we see in the third row. QueryStudentDatabaseUserControl is a query user control that gives an admin the ability to look up students that are or are not in their classes.</p>
