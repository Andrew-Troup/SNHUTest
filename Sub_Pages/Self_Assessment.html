							<h2>Introduction to ePortfolio</h2>
						</header>
						<p>In my ePortfolio what you will see is a project that I developed over the course of six weeks where I tasked myself with designing and developing a class and course records system and UI for a school. The project completed was a carryover from another class where I was asked to design most of the project, but did not develop any of it, until now.</p>
						<p>In my ePortfolio you should see some of my skills in designing and then implementing said design into actual code. As well as, provide the user within depth knowledge in how I develop my code.</p>
						<p>In my ePortfolio I will show case some of the algorithms and data structures I put into my capstone project. For instance, the UI I designed to handle student querying or how I handled database updating.</p>
						<p>Finally, you will see how I designed and developed my database. The thought process I put into the design; for instance, why I decided to break apart studentâ€™s classes into three different arrays.</p>

							<h2>Reflection on Capstone<br />
							Development</h2>
						</header>
						<p>While I was developing my capstone project I was thinking about my professional development and how this project has possibilities in the professional world. I know the content itself may not be applicable, but UI development, Database development, software designing, and the many other things I had to accomplish during this project were all applicable.</p>
						<p>A lot of the things I applied to the development of this project I have used professionally and vice versa. I have used UML diagrams to describe the functionality of my code to those who do not understand code. Or I have used design choices I learned while programming professionally in my academia. </p>
						<p>The challenges that I faced were inexperience in database development / design. I have never had to design a whole database. Most of the time I am given a series of instructions on what is needed and told to meet them. This time I was given loose instructions to follow but was given a lot of personal liberties in how to accomplish the task.</p>
						<p>Another challenge I faced was integrating the database into my UI. I have never had to integrate a database into a C# project, so it was all new and interesting for me to learn.</p>

							<h2>Experiences in CS<br />
							at SNHU</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Throughout my time at SNHU I have learned a lot of important and practical information. For instance, I have learned the phases of the software development life cycle (SDLC), how to create different designs, how to design databases, and the list could go on, but I think the point has been made. The information learned and experiences gained at SNHU have been fun but challenging. Providing me with a well-grounded idea to the experiences gained while employed in the computer science field.</p>
						<p>I have participated in the development of multiple different databases using different languages, the development of projects in Python, and taken classes in using OpenGL. I have advanced my knowledge in C++, C#, and python while at SNHU.</p>
						<p>Other than the practical knowledge I have learned while at SNHU I have also learned sage advice from my professors. One piece that I will take with me to the end of my development career is learning when enough is enough. I had professors constantly reiterate the ideas that re-formatting your code is important, but at some point, we need to move forward. At some point we need to complete the project.</p>
