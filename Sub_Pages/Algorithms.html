								<h2>Narrative about Algorithms<br />
								and Data structures</h2>
							</header>
							<p>After I designed most of my capstone project, I set out to implement the algorithms and data structures I designed. Therefore, all the algorithms and data structures included in my capstone project were added from week one to week 6 of the course. </p>
							<p>While I was designing the code, I wanted to give myself some challenges that exceeded the original requirements. Some ideas that would challenge me and be fun to accomplish. The first was the UI design, the UI design is not complex, but my knowledge of C# WPF is rusty, and this strained my capabilities. The second challenge was querying the student database based upon the Admin desires.</p>
							<p>While I was developing these I was constantly having to re-adjust the designs to meet my abilities, or to meet the reality of WPF. For instance, I changed how I was going to query the student database because I was uncertain during the design phase of how I was going to build my database.</p>

								<h2>Data Structure: How My UI Communicates<br />
								 Updates To My Database</h2>
							</header>
							<p>When a student is selected in the AdminStudentTreeView (first image), it is loaded into the StudentRecordLayout. Since the user is an Admin, they have the privilege to edit all information pertaining to the student (Personal and Academic). Before an Admin can edit the information though, they will have to hit the Edit button. This will enable all the text boxes pertaining to the region they want to edit.</p>
							<p>While the information is being edited by the Admin, the changed values and the effected rows are being stored into a queue in the format { row_name : new_value } (second image). As the admin edits the different rows the information is being queued up. When the admin completes editing the desired information, they toggle the edit button. This is when all the changes are written to the database.</p>
							<p>The third image is the code that will update the student’s record in the database. It will iterate through each item that was changed by the user and update the database given the current student ID.</p>

								<h2>Algorithm: How I Query<br />
								Students Collection</h2>
							</header>
							<p>The only time that an individual can query the student collection is if they are an admin. As an admin, they have the privilege to query the student’s collection and they can do so by clicking a button. When they do click the query student’s button a UI will appear.</p>
							<p>The way that the UI query works is by following the format of all queries in MongoDB: { row_name : Value }. At the end of each row the user can append an operator to it, either and / or. One last things to note about the UI is the bracers in the row. Combined rows are surrounded by another pair of bracers, like rows one and two. </p>
							<p>With the how to out of the way, I want to talk about some of the logic behind the query student collection UI after the user completes the query they want to perform. After the user clicks Apply, my code will perform ComposeFilter. In this function I am parsing the information from the UI and composing the filter I will use to search the database. The information is then concatenated into filter, which is a MongoDB data structure, based upon the parsing.</p>
